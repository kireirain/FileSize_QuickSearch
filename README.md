# FileSize_QuickSearch
烦死了，写的代码或者用的其他东西，一旦文件多了，就发现主文件夹特别大，但是又不能快速发现哪个文件是最大的几个。别的软件这种功能都不太好用，因此我直接写个脚本。以后可以用qt开发一下界面。


"I'm so annoyed that as soon as I have a lot of files, I realize that the main folder is unusually large, but I can't quickly identify which files are the largest. Other software doesn't provide this feature in a user-friendly way, so I decided to write a script. In the future, I might use Qt to develop a GUI for it."
